# Alarm-Clock-Python-Script
This Python script serves as a simple alarm clock application that allows users to set alarms and get notified with a sound when the specified time is reached. The user is prompted to input the alarm time in 12-hour format, and the script continuously checks the current time until the alarm time matches.
